<h1>Interests Calculator v.1</h1>
<p>This project consist in a simple interests calculator for compound interests. It works as a handy tool to keep track of personal finances in case borrowing is not stranger for you.</p>
<p>It was made for my personal use and I plan to expand it base in my needs. I may later migrate it to Laravel for scalability and increased features.</p>

Better <code>.csv</code> data outputs for managing accountabiliy and better <code>.csv</code> integration to support more accounting features.</li>

</ul>
<p><b>Note: </b>work is being made to structure the project stages in tables for better presentation of the progress.</p>
